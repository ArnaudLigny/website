Sharing our open source projects through a dedicated site, here is the objective of this site. We will also publish news about our projects or technical articles.

## Static is basic ðŸ’—

To develop this site, we want to go back to basics: **a static site**.

The site was created with the static site generator: [Cecil](https://cecil.app)

It's not the most popular but we liked its simplicity and functionality (and its developer is very nice!).

We use Cloudflare Page for site hosting.

No Google Analytics, no GDPR modal, no Facebook or Twitter highlighting, no webmarketing, the web before 2004 ðŸ‘¾

We wish you good surfing on this site,

The Pixel Open Team
